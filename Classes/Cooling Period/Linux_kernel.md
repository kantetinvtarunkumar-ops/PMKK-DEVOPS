# Linux Kernel & Basic Commands  
## 1. Uses and Functionality of the Kernel in an OS

The kernel is the core of an operating system, managing system resources and providing essential services for applications.  
**Key Functions:**  
- **Process Management:** Scheduling and resource allocation for processes  
- **Memory Management:** Allocating/deallocating memory for processes  
- **Device Management:** Handling I/O operations for devices  
- **File System Management:** Managing file storage and retrieval  
- **Security Management:** Enforcing security policies and user access  
- **Network Management:** Managing network connections and services

### Who Manages Execution of Instructions?

- **CPU Control Unit (CU):** Executes low-level instructions  
- **Kernel:** Manages process scheduling, resource allocation, and system stability  
Both work together for efficient and reliable instruction execution.
